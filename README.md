# pythonGame

## Chaser

This is one of the first games ever coded in Python, it was the first time being introduced to PyGame and running moving parts on a screen.
The game is simple, Once you have downloaded the project open it where it will automatically start and you will 
have to cath the star before it leaves the screen.

If you bump into any object that is not a start the game will be over and you will loose.

To install and run the game:
1. Download all the contents of the file.
2. In your command prompt cd to the containing folder.
3. Once you are in the folder run python3 chaser.py

As you open the game it will start so you will have to think quick to catch the star!!

The game was developed as a learning project and will be maintained and developed as times goes by, the game will change
as my experience as a devoper grows so will the difficulty of the game.

Enjoy!
